**In short:** Cyberduck is a free, open-source file transfer client for macOS and Windows that handles S3 alongside FTP, SFTP, WebDAV and cloud drives. S3 Explorer is dedicated to S3: it adds Linux, presets for 25 S3-compatible providers and a local index for very large buckets, but does not do other protocols.

## At a glance

| | Cyberduck 9.5.4 | S3 Explorer 0.3.9 |
|---|---|---|
| Platforms (GUI) | macOS, Windows | Windows, macOS, Linux |
| Linux | Command-line client (`duck`) only | Native app (AppImage, .deb, .rpm) |
| Protocols | S3, FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, SMB, Azure, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive and more | S3 and S3-compatible only |
| License | Free software (GPL), donation prompt removed with a key from a 10 USD donation | Free with all features, 5 profiles; 11.50 € lifetime licence removes the limit |
| S3-compatible providers | Connection profiles installed from Preferences → Profiles | 25 built-in presets + custom endpoint |
| Path-style servers | A separate "deprecated path style" profile or a hidden setting | Set per connection, locked where the provider requires it |
| Large buckets | Lists folders on demand | Local index for search across millions of objects |

## Where Cyberduck goes further

- **One client for every protocol.** If you also use SFTP, WebDAV or cloud drives, Cyberduck covers them all.
- **Mountain Duck**, a separate paid product from the same team, mounts storage as a drive in Finder or Explorer.
- **Mature S3 features**: versioning with revert and MFA Delete, Glacier restore and share links, documented in detail.
- **A long track record**: its oldest releases ran on Mac OS X 10.2.

## Where S3 Explorer goes further

- **Linux desktop app.** Cyberduck has no Linux GUI.
- **S3-compatible setup without profiles.** Pick the provider, and the endpoint format, region and addressing mode are filled in.
- **Big buckets.** The local index finds objects without re-listing. Cyberduck's documentation notes that listing may need an extra request per file to show modification dates, which slows large folders.
- **S3-specific tools**: per-request metrics with cost estimates, cleanup of incomplete multipart uploads, a built-in editor and previews.

## Which one to choose

- **You use several protocols**: Cyberduck.
- **You work on Linux**: S3 Explorer.
- **You manage many S3-compatible providers or very large buckets**: S3 Explorer.
- **You want storage mounted as a drive**: Mountain Duck (paid) or rclone mount.
