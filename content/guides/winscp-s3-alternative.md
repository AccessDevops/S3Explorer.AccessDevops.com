**In short:** WinSCP is a free (GPL) Windows file transfer client that supports S3 alongside SFTP, FTP, WebDAV and SCP. It is a good fit for moving files to a bucket. A dedicated S3 client such as S3 Explorer adds S3-specific features (versions, metadata, presets for S3-compatible providers, search in large buckets) and runs on macOS and Linux too.

## What WinSCP does with S3

- Buckets appear as folders at the root; creating a folder there creates a bucket.
- It uses the S3 REST API and documents connection guides for Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Backblaze B2, Cloudflare R2 and Oracle Object Storage, and says other S3-API services work too.
- Scripting and a .NET assembly make it useful for automated transfers on Windows.

A documented quirk: buckets shared from another account, or buckets you are not allowed to list, do not appear at the root; you set `/bucketname` as the initial remote directory instead.
