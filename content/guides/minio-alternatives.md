title: MinIO is unmaintained — risks and alternatives
description: MinIO's open-source edition is archived, unpatched and has no images. What changed, the security risk, and which free or paid S3 storage to move to.

**In short:** MinIO's open-source edition no longer receives fixes. The repository is archived, no binaries or images are published, and the 2026 security fixes ship only in MinIO's proprietary AIStor. For a self-hosted replacement, the main options are Silo (a drop-in MinIO fork), RustFS, SeaweedFS, Garage and Ceph RGW; managed S3 storage avoids the question altogether.

## Why MinIO became the default

For a decade, MinIO was the answer to "S3 outside AWS":

- **One static Go binary**, running on a laptop, in Docker Compose, or on bare metal.
- **Strong S3 compatibility**, good enough for most SDKs and tools to work unchanged.
- **Fast**, with erasure coding and distributed mode for multi-node clusters.
- **Ubiquitous**: Helm charts, a Kubernetes operator, the `mc` client, and countless projects shipping it as their default storage.

## What happened

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2021 | License moves from Apache 2.0 to AGPL v3. |
| May 2025 | The community web console is reduced to an object browser. User management, policies and lifecycle move to the paid product. |
| October 2025 | No more binaries or Docker images for the community edition: source only. The last release, `RELEASE.2025-10-15`, fixes a high-severity privilege escalation (CVE-2025-62506) but was never published as an official image. |
| December 2025 | The repository enters maintenance mode: no features, no pull requests, security fixes "case by case". |
| 2026 | The README states the repository is no longer maintained, and `minio/minio`, `minio/mc` and `minio/operator` are archived (read-only). |

MinIO's own README now points to **AIStor**, its proprietary product, as the alternative.

## The security problem

This is the part that matters for anything in production. Since January 2026, MinIO has published **seven security advisories** on the archived repository, including:

- **CVE-2026-41145** (high): unauthenticated object write through a signature bypass in unsigned-trailer uploads.
- **CVE-2026-40344** (high): unauthenticated object write through missing signature verification in Snowball auto-extract.
- **CVE-2026-34204** (high): SSE metadata injection through replication headers.
- **CVE-2026-39414** (high): denial of service through unbounded memory allocation in S3 Select.
- **CVE-2026-42600** (medium): path traversal on multi-node clusters, up to reading host files when MinIO runs as root, the historical Docker default.

The fixed versions listed in these advisories ship in **AIStor**. None of them exists in the open-source repository, which has had no code change since November 2025. In other words: **the open-source MinIO is vulnerable to known, documented flaws, and will stay so.**

The last official Docker image (`RELEASE.2025-09-07`) is also older than the October 2025 fix.

## What to expect in the coming months

- **More advisories, fixed only in AIStor.** The pattern is established; there is no reason for it to change.
- **No images, no packages.** Pulling `minio/minio` already fails. Any rebuild, node replacement or new environment depends on an image you mirrored yourself or build from source.
- **The ecosystem moves away.** Helm charts, operators and projects that bundled MinIO are switching their default storage.
- **AIStor Free is not open source.** It is a free licence for a proprietary binary, limited to **single-node** deployments (no distributed mode, no replication), with terms that MinIO can revise.

What not to expect: a return of the community edition. A running cluster will keep serving objects, but it is now a frozen, unpatched component.

## Alternatives

### Free and open source

| Project | License | Best for | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Silo** (formerly `pgsty/minio`) | AGPL v3 | Staying on MinIO with minimal change | Community fork: rebuilt binaries and images, console restored, security fixes. Drop-in replacement. |
| **RustFS** | Apache 2.0 | A MinIO-like distributed model, permissive license | 1.0 released in September 2026. Young: test S3 compatibility on your workload. |
| **SeaweedFS** | Apache 2.0 | Very large numbers of small objects, S3 + filesystem/HDFS/WebDAV | Mature (since 2015). More components to operate. |
| **Garage** | AGPL v3 | Small, geo-distributed clusters on modest hardware | Stable, simple to run. Not built for raw throughput. |
| **Ceph RGW** | LGPL | Large deployments, strict S3 semantics | The enterprise reference. Heavy to operate. |
| **Versity Gateway** | Apache 2.0 | Exposing an existing filesystem or POSIX storage as S3 | Lightweight gateway, not a distributed store. |

### Paid

- **MinIO AIStor Enterprise**: the same lineage with support and fixes, under a commercial subscription. The path of least change, at a price.
- **Commercially supported Ceph** (IBM Storage Ceph, Croit, and others) for large on-premise deployments.
- **Managed S3 storage**, when self-hosting is not a requirement: Cloudflare R2 (no egress fees), Backblaze B2 and Wasabi (low cost per TB), Hetzner, OVHcloud and Scaleway (EU hosting), or AWS S3 itself.

### How to choose

- **Need to stay on MinIO for now** → Silo, then plan a longer-term target.
- **Single node, development, CI** → Garage or RustFS.
- **Multi-node, MinIO-like** → RustFS, after testing.
- **Huge object counts, several protocols** → SeaweedFS.
- **Large scale, strict compatibility, a team to run it** → Ceph RGW.
- **No wish to operate storage at all** → a managed provider.

## Migrating

1. **Inventory** buckets, policies, users, lifecycle rules and versioning. They do not all have an equivalent on the target.
2. **Copy the data** with `rclone sync` or `mc mirror` (the archived `mc` client still works as a plain S3 client).
3. **Test the S3 calls your applications actually make** (multipart, presigned URLs, versioning, batch delete) against the new endpoint before switching.
4. **Keep the old cluster read-only** until the new one has served production for a while.

During the transition, both endpoints coexist. A desktop client that connects to any S3-compatible service, such as [S3 Explorer](/), makes it easy to compare the old and new buckets side by side. The [MinIO](/providers/minio/) and [Ceph](/providers/ceph/) connection guides list the settings for each.
